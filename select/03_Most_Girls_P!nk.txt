I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush
That I just did not want

Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly
Gettin' paid was everything

But I'm not every girl
And I don't need that world
To validate me

'Cause shorty got a job
Shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart

Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling
Got my own thing
Got the ching-ching
I just want real love

Most girls want a man
With the mean green
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love
(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha, ah, ah)

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost
How much he spent on me

Seek for a man who's got the means
To be giving you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl
Could want or even dream

But I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G
To take care of me

'Cause shorty got a job
Shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart
No, oh

Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling
Got my own thing
Got the ching-ching
I just want real love

Most girls want a man
With the mean green
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling
Got my own thing
Got the ching-ching
I just want real love (I just want real love)

Most girls want a man
With the mean green
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha, ah, ah, ah)

(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha, ah, ah, ah)

I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G
To take care of me, no

'Cause shorty got a job
Shorty got a car
Shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if
It's not in my heart

Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling
Got my own thing
Got the ching-ching
I just want real love (I just want real love, can you give me real love?)

Most girls want a man
With the mean green
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man
With the bling-bling
Got my own thing
Got the ching-ching
I just want real love (real love)

Most girls want a man
With the mean green
Don't wanna dance
If he can't be
Everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha, ah, ah) oh, oh babe, 'cause I'm not most girls

(A-ha, a-ha, a-ha, a-ha, ah, ah) don't wanna dance if he can't be oh, everything

I, I just want real love, said I gotta have real love (A-ha, a-ha)

Everything that, can you be everything that I dream of?
